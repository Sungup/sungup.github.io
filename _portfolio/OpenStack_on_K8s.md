I have joined a group seminar about the OpenStack on Kubernetes. OpenStack has
some limitations about the HA and non-stop service on the baremetal based
environments. To overcome this, there are many projects **OpenStack on
Container** like **[Kolla](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Kolla)**,
**[Helm](https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-helm/latest/)**, and
**[StarlingX](https://starlingx.io)**.

From this seminar, I'll expand my horizon for the next generation datacenters
driven by IIoT, EdgeComputing, and 5G.
