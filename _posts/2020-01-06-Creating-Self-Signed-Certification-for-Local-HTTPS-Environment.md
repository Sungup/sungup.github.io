Before start build-up the K8s dashboard  with Ingress, we need to make the
self-signed certification file to connect the K8s dashboard. Making root
certification is better solution to reduce making and registering each
certification file of the other app example.

1. **[Creating Self-Signed Certification for Local HTTPS Environment]**
2. *[Installing Ingress-Nginx on the Private Network]*
3. *[Install and Access Kubernetes Dashboard]*

## Create root certification file

First of all generate the root private key and certification file. You must
enter the passphrase while generating the root key file. *(**my.domain** is the
example domain. Please change that to your domain name.)*

```bash
# Generate private key for root-cert
openssl genrsa -des3 -out my.domain.key 2048;

# Generate root-cert file
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key my.domain.key \
            -sha256 -days 1825 -out my.domain.pem;
```

After generating the root certification file, you need the that cert file on
you system. Copy the `my.domain.pem` file on your PC. In my case, I use
`Keychain Access` on my MacBook and register certification file on the system
directory.

## Create CA-Signed certification for the local sites

Next we generate the local site certification file. I'll use that certification
file for the K8s dashboard, and use the **k8s.my.domain** for the example
sub-domain name.

```bash
# Generate private key for the sub-domain
openssl genrsa -out k8s.my.domain.key 2048;

# Generate the sub-domain's CSR file
openssl req -new -key k8s.my.domain.key -out k8s.my.domain.csr;
```

While generating the CSR file, you must sync the input information with the
root certification file without `Common Name`.

After that, we should define the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension
(Please read the [Brad Touesnard's article]). Following contents is the
template file of SAN extension.

```ini
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = example.com
DNS.2 = example.com.example.ip.xip.io
```

Store this conents as `example.com.ext.template` and generate the sub-domain's
SAN extension file `k8s.my.domain.ext` using the `cat` and `sed` command. Using
the SAN extension file, generate the sub-domain's certification file **(.crt)**
for the k8s dashboard site.

```bash
# Generate the SAN extension file
cat example.com.ext.template \
    | sed "s/example.com/k8s.my.domain/" \
    | sed "s/example.ip/XX.XX.XX.XX/" > k8s.my.domain.ext;

# Generate the certification file for the sub-domain
openssl x509 -req -in k8s.my.domain.csr \
    -CA my.domain.pem -CAkey my.domain.key -CAcreateserial \
    -days 1825 -sha256 -extfile k8s.my.domain.ext \
    -out k8s.my.domain.crt;
```

## Trouble Shooting

Even if you registered the certification fils, Safari can't connect the self-
certified pages. If you changed the certification file many times in the web
pages, Safari would compare between the cached old cert and the new cert,
and protect that site with a message, *Safari Can't Open the Page â€“ Safari
can't open the page because Safari can't establish a secure connection to the
server.*

To solve this problem, you must clean the HSTS cache with the menu at
`Go to Safari > Clear History... > all history`. If you clean the all history
in Safari, now you can access the self-signed pages without any fault message.
